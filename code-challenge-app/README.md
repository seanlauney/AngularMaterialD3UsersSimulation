  <h4>Designed to give a visual representation of friend's and their relationships with their friends.</h4>

  <h3>Gettings started </h3>
  <p>The quickest way to build and interact with the model is to load mock data.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>1. Click the edit users button on the top toolbar.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>User the slider at the bottom of the table to select the numbe of users to load, or leave at at the default
        setting.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Click on load mock data.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>After the data has finished loading you can view or delete the users in the table, click anywhere outside of
        the
        table to close it.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Interacting with the model</h3>

  <p>The model is interactive you can zoom and pan the entire model using the touchpad or mouse.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>The nodes are connected with elastic threads, the number of threads and the amount of tension binding them
        demonstrates the nodes relationship's. Unconnected nodes do not have relationships.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Dragging a node will allow you to see the threads in more detail and the rate the node springs back is an
        indication of how many connections this node has.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Clicking a node will open a dialog showing the user details and a mock photo.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
